LEGACY! - Moved to a module here: https://github.com/pianist1119/Hot67-Bluetooth-Scouter

A simple firebase database table-viewer for the Hot team, started from this: https://github.com/evrencoskun/TableViewSampleApp and worked up

Currently capable of querying rankings and match schedules from TBA, showing Averages + Maximum, and searching by team/match.
